# Homework 1 -- free response questions
Due Monday, 2/15

1. What are the compiler flags used to generate, assembly, object files, and linking object files to create an executable.

2. Describe the different steps of compiling a C program.

3. Compare and contrast compiling C with compiling Java. What about executing a C binary versus a Java program?

4. Can you run a pre-compiled binary on any computer? For example, could a binary produced on a Windows
   machine run on an iPhone?

5. Suppose you need to store 128 bits of data but are on a 64-bit machine. Describe a way to store
   this data in the most compact for possible (hint: if you use an array you will need to store the
   length. There is a more compact solution).
