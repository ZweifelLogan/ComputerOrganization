# Homework 1 -- free response questions
Due Monday, 2/15

1. What are the compiler flags used to generate, assembly, object files, and linking object files to create an executable.
      -o, -s and -i


2. Describe the different steps of compiling a C program.
      Preprocessor, compiler, assembler, Linker and all those output and executable program

3. Compare and contrast compiling C with compiling Java. What about executing a C binary versus a Java program?
      java is an interpreted language and c converts code into machine language when it compiles
      so the two are very different. C is much more customizable becuase you have so much control over how
      your program is built which is a plus compared to Java. It is generally easier to compile in Java though


4. Can you run a pre-compiled binary on any computer? For example, could a binary produced on a Windows
   machine run on an iPhone?
      If the computer the binary was compiled on is similar to the new one , such as two 32bit Window OS'
         the binary would most likely work. Switching between different types of computers such as a Windows
         to an iPhone would most likely not work 

5. Suppose you need to store 128 bits of data but are on a 64-bit machine. Describe a way to store
   this data in the most compact for possible (hint: if you use an array you will need to store the
   length. There is a more compact solution).
      I think a hash table wouldn't be a bad way to do it.
